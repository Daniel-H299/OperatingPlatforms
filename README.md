# The Gaming Room Software Design Document
# Client Overview
The Gaming Room specializes in creating web-based games. They requested the design of a scalable and reusable software system for their game, Draw It or Lose It. The system needed to support unique game instances, efficient player management, and adhere to object-oriented principles.

# Strengths in Documentation
One of the key strengths of the documentation was the clarity in describing design decisions, supported by detailed diagrams and pseudocode. These elements helped ensure the client and development team had a shared understanding of the solution.

# Benefits of the Design Process
Working through the design document provided a structured approach that made coding more efficient. It helped identify potential challenges early on, such as ensuring the Singleton pattern’s thread-safety.

# Areas for Improvement
If I were to revise any part of the document, it would be the Design Constraints section. I would expand on how scalability concerns were addressed, providing additional detail or metrics to strengthen the explanation.

# User-Focused Design
The user’s needs were a top priority in the design process. For instance, their requirement for unique game instances was addressed using the Singleton and Iterator patterns. Prioritizing user needs ensures that the final product aligns with their goals and provides a seamless experience.

# Approach to Software Design
In this project, I focused on creating a detailed blueprint before coding, leveraging design patterns and visual aids like UML diagrams. For future projects, I would incorporate more iterative feedback with the client and use tools like flowcharts more extensively to refine designs further.
